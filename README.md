# Hey, I'm **Vasig**  

I'm a student diving deep into mathematics, physics and computation.
In a very interesting phase of my life.

**What I wanna Do:**  
- Explore math, physics, machine learning, quantum computing, and computational theory  
- Obsess over perfection in deep understanding of the universe, creative agency and problem solving.

**Other Interests:**  
- Human behavior, psychology, and the nature of intelligence and consciousness  
- Music theory, sound production, guitar and piano

**Philosophy:**  
- I like to think of life as a game with a difficulty I chose before coming in so if things gets difficult, it's probably because I have already completed all the easy levels long back. The quit button is disabled, despite the best thing I could do right now do is to quit.
- Curiosity with depth and the fear of mediocrity drives me. They are my carrot and stick respectively. I admire those who challenge the limits of understanding.
- Play the game, win.
