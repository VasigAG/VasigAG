# Hey, I'm **Vasig**  

**Ambitious. Driven by the fear of mediocrity.**  
I'm an 18-year-old student diving deep into mathematics, physics, computation, and algorithms.  

**What I Do**  
- Exploring math, physics, machine learning, quantum computing, and computational theory  
- Obsessing over perfection in problem-solving and creative agency

**Other Interests**  
- Human behavior, psychology, and the nature of intelligence and consciousness  
- Music theory, guitar, and piano

**Currently Working On**  
- Solving life's shits.
- Structuring my own knowledge base for long-term retention  

**Philosophy**  
I like to think of life as a game with a difficulty I chose before coming in so if things gets difficult, it's probably because I have already completed all the easy levels long back. 
Curiosity with depth drives me, and I admire those who challenge the limits of understanding.
